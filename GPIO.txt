GPIO pins unassociated with the PRU cannot be accessed in the assembly code.
Meaning only GPIO pins in registers 30 or 31 can be accessed.

These other GPIO pins should work, but I could not get them to.
See these link for an example program to test the GPIO via the PRU

It also seems like the clocking systems for GPIO 1, 2 and 3 are disabled (GPIO0 will be always enabled) by default when booting up the BBB
Supposed fix to this is to run these cmds to export a pin from each of the GPIO banks:
# echo 5 > /sys/class/gpio/export
# echo 65 > /sys/class/gpio/export
# echo 105 > /sys/class/gpio/export

I've tried this, but it still would not work for me.
One additional thing you could try that I did not, is exporting the number and direction of each pin you want to use

echo 30 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio30/direction
